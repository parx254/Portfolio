Hi!

I created a personal portfolio that was made from scratch. It was not built with Wix.com, Squarespace, or any other website builders you may see with other personal portfolios.

The website utilizes Google Analytics for web tracking, Google Search Console to get on the interweb, and Google Tag Manager for tagging.

Let me know what your thoughts are!

I am not using the Robots.txt anymore.
